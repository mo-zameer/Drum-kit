# Drum-kit
A drum kit game is an interactive application that simulates a drum kit using visual and audio elements. This project implements a drum kit game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript DOM manipulation.
Game Mechanics:

1)Drum Pads: The game features virtual drum pads representing different drums, such as a snare, bass drum, kick drum, toms, and cymbals.
2)Sound Effects: Each drum pad triggers a corresponding sound effect when clicked.
3)Visual Feedback: The drum pads may change color or animate to provide visual feedback.
4)Play Along: Users can play along to pre-recorded drum beats or create their own rhythms.
